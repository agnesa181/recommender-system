I first tried to do the recommender system with the movie 'Home Alone'. Unfortunately, I got little to no result. So I changed it the movie with 'Scary Movie', as it has more than one part and it fits the current time of the year (halloween). After this I had a problem with the rank limit of > 0.5 as it was set too high. I first tried to do it without but then I had the problem of negative rankings. So i included the value rank > 0.001.
